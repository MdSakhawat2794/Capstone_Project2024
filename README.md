# **Medical Insurance Price Prediction Project**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on predicting the prices of medical insurance based on various personal attributes such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoker status, and region. The primary goal is to build a predictive model that can assist insurance companies in making informed decisions about insurance policy pricing.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is named Medical_insurance.csv. It contains several attributes, including:

Age: Age of the policyholder.
Sex: Gender of the policyholder (male or female).
BMI: Body Mass Index of the policyholder, providing an understanding of body weight relative to height.
Children: The number of children/dependents covered by the insurance plan.
Smoker: Indicates whether the policyholder is a smoker (yes or no).
Region: The beneficiary's residential area in the US (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest).
Charges: The individual medical costs billed by the insurance.

## **Objectives**
To explore and visualize the dataset to understand the relationships between different attributes and insurance costs.
To preprocess the data for modeling, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
To compare various regression models to predict the insurance costs effectively.
To evaluate the models based on metrics like R-squared, MSE, and MAE to find the best performer.

## **Tools Used**
Python: Primary programming language used for data manipulation and analysis.
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive computing environment where the analysis and modeling are conducted.
Pandas: Python library for data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: Library for numerical operations.
Matplotlib/Seabian: Used for data visualization.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library used to implement regression models.

## **Files**
medical_insurance.csv: Contains the raw data for the project.
medical_insurance_price_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with all the exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, and machine learning modeling.
